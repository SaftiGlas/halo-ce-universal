/*
FORGE_AI.C

One of Forge's parts (halo_mod.h, halo_mods.c): AI characters in any map, from the dev tools'
menu (in forge mode: 1, D-pad right or X), on the "AI" tab. A keyboard and
a controller work alike.

- Character: the actor variants the map has (tags of the group actv whose
  actor and biped are there): in a multiplayer map only those the launcher
  brings in from another map (mods.json "import", the actv group; the
  launcher's Ctrl-T list), such as the grunts, hunters and elites of the
  campaign.
- Spawn at the crosshair: a character stands there as the map's own
  creatures do (the biped is made, dressed as the variant says and given an
  actor with the game's own ai_attach_free), so it sees, shoots, takes cover
  and dies as in the campaign.
- Faction: the team new characters are on: their own (a grunt's body is
  the Covenant's, a combat form's the Flood's), the player's side, or the
  human, Covenant, Flood or sentinel team of the campaign. Every team is the
  enemy of every other (game/game_allegiance.c), so characters of two
  factions fight each other as they fight the player, with the game's own
  perception and combat; those on the player's side fight the rest.
- Aggression: cautious characters defend and never charge, normal ones fight
  as their actor says, berserk ones charge once they fight.
- Squad: how many are added at once, at the crosshair. The first
  leads (it patrols the waypoints); the others follow it in a V while
  nothing draws them away, and whatever one of them fights, the rest are
  made to see (the game's magic sight), so the squad fights together.
- Attack on sight: patrolling characters break off to fight an enemy they
  see or hear (the command list's initiative and targeting), and go back to
  their patrol once the fight is over and they are idle again. Off, they
  walk their round whatever happens.
- Waypoints: "add a waypoint" puts a point at the crosshair; the points are
  drawn in the world. With two or more, characters walk from one to the next
  and round again, pausing at each, until something draws their attention:
  the game's own command list (ai_command_lists of the scenario, one made
  here for each map, with go to and pause commands and a loop) sends them, so
  the game's pathfinding, which multiplayer maps have, takes them round walls
  and up ramps.
- New characters (a squad's leader) patrol along the points by themselves, or
  "send everyone" does it for the ones already there; "remove all" takes
  them away.
- A waypoint is picked up like an object while the waypoints are shown:
  aim at it and press A / enter (flying) or F4, aim to move it, A / enter
  puts it down (on the floor there), B / escape puts it back, Y / delete
  removes it. The characters then walk the changed round.

The points and characters are forgotten when the map changes; nothing is
kept for other players: local games only.
