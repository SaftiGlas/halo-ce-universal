/*
FORGE_EDIT.C

One of Forge's parts (halo_mod.h, mods.c): an object's popup, with the dev tools'
crosshair (port/linux/game/forge.c): move it, copy it, change its size,
turn and height, remove it.

While the camera flies, X (on a keyboard or a controller) with the
crosshair on an object opens the popup beside the crosshair. It is the
object's own: the object is the one the crosshair was on, which is marked
with a box while the popup is shown, wherever the camera then looks. X
while an object is held (picked up, or just spawned) opens the popup about
that object: it stays where it is while the popup is shown, and is held
again when the popup closes. Up and
down choose a row, left and right change its value, enter or A act, escape,
B or X again close it. With the mouse, the wheel chooses a row, the wheel
with the left button held changes its value, the left button acts and the
right button closes it. The rows:

	Move              pick it up, as the tools' pick up key does: put down
	                  where it is let go, put back when that is cancelled
	Duplicate         a copy of it (its tag, turn and size), held until it
	                  is put down; cancelled, the copy is removed
	Size              its scale, in tenths of its own size
	Turn              about the upright, by 15 degrees
	Tilt              its nose up and down, by 15 degrees
	Roll              about its length, by 15 degrees
	Height            up and down, by a twentieth of a world unit
	Prefab            select it for a prefab, or leave it out again
	                  (forge_prefabs.c)
	Team              the team it is kept for: none, red, blue, or 2 to 15
	Placed at start   made when the map variant loads, or only while
	                  Forge is on (to edit)
	Game types        every game type, or one of them: with Forge off it
	                  is made only in that one
	Respawn           the seconds it respawns after, by 5 (0 the game
	                  type's; kept with the variant, not used yet)
	Group             the editor's group it is in (1 to 99, 0 none)
	Comment           a note about it, typed on the keyboard
	Remove            remove it
	Undo remove       bring back the last removed object (the last 16, one
	                  at a time)

About a held object, Move is "Put down" (where it is), Duplicate leaves a
copy where it is, Turn, Tilt, Roll and Height change how it is held, and in place of
Undo remove a Step row has the step it turns in while held (as V, which X
was on a controller).

On a keyboard, Delete removes the object under the crosshair with the popup
closed, and so does Y on a controller while the camera flies (the tools'
remove hook). The object under the crosshair is the one the dev tools would pick
up: flying, where the crosshair points, else where the player looks. While
the camera flies it is marked on the screen with its name.

Objects are made and removed only with the game's own object_new and
object_delete. The player, what they ride and carry, and anything that
holds a player (a vehicle with another player in it) are never marked, so
they have no popup; object indices are checked with object_try_and_get
before every use. As with the dev tools, all of this works only in Forge
games, and not during cutscenes or while the tools' menu is open or they
hold an object (their own delete then removes the held object). In a system
link game a client's popup moves the object (the host is asked, as for the
tools' pick up key); the other rows are the host's.

A changed turn, tilt, roll, height or size is kept by the tools' layout as a moved object is
(port/linux/game/forge_layout.c), for the objects the tools made and the
map's own alike. Team, Placed at start, Game types, Respawn, Group and Comment are the
object's properties in the map variant (forge_layout_set_properties): the
host's in a system link game, kept for the objects the tools made and the
map's own alike; a copy and an object brought back have them too.

An object brought back is a new object of the same tag, place, turn and
scale: what it carried (a biped's weapon) and its state (damage, an actor's
orders) are gone. Removals are forgotten when the map changes, and when the
game goes back to a checkpoint, which brings the removed objects back
itself.
