/*
FORGE_PREFABS.C

One of Forge's parts (halo_mod.h, halo_mods.c): several objects selected with the dev
tools' crosshair (port/linux/game/forge.c), saved together as a prefab, and
placed again as often as wanted.

All of it is on the "Prefab" tab of the dev tools' menu (1, D-pad right or,
flying, X; LB / RB, Page Up / Page Down, or T / V change tab). The rows:

	At the crosshair  the object the dev tools would pick up, or nothing
	Select            select it, or leave it out again (B on a keyboard
	                  while the camera flies, with the menu closed; an
	                  object's popup, X on it, has a row for it too:
	                  forge_edit.c)
	Clear             select nothing
	Save              the selection as a new prefab; its name is typed on
	                  the keyboard
	Prefab            the saved prefab to place or delete (left, right)
	Place             make its objects and hold them at the crosshair, as
	                  the tools hold one object: left and right turn them
	                  (T: about another axis; V or X: in steps), up and
	                  down raise them, the right stick orbits the camera
	                  around them (with RT, or the right mouse button, it
	                  turns them), enter or A put them down, escape or B
	                  remove them again
	Delete            delete the prefab (asked twice)

The selected objects are marked in the world with a box each. A prefab that
is held is its objects themselves, made with the game's own object_new: the
tools hold the one nearest the prefab's middle (forge_hold_object,
port/linux/game/forge.c) and the others keep their places and turns from
it, so the prefab moves and turns as one thing. Put down, they are kept by
the tools' layout as spawned objects are (port/linux/game/forge_layout.c).

A prefab holds each object's tag, turn and scale, and its place from the
prefab's own origin: the middle of its objects, at the height of the
lowest. Put down, that origin is where the crosshair points.

Files: u:\forge\<map>\prefab_NN.txt (NN 01 to 32) in the save root, beside
the map's layouts, text, one thing a line: prefabs belong to the map they
were made on, whose tags they name. An object whose tag is not in the map
(a layout's imports are not loaded) is left out when the prefab is placed.

Selecting and saving read the game only, and work on every machine; placing
makes objects, and is the host's in a system link game.
