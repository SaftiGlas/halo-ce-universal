/*
FORGE.C

In-game dev tools for the native ports (port/linux, port/windows,
port/android): on in local and system link games of the Forge game type,
which the main menu's FORGE plays (a slayer variant with GAME_VARIANT_FORGE_FLAG,
game/game_engine.c; it is not one of the gametypes to choose), or in every
game with HALO_FORGE=all (see
port/linux/README.md, "Dev tools"). The byte-matching build never compiles
this file.

	Home / D-pad up
	        forge mode: the player becomes the monitor and flies
	        (forge_monitor.c); again gives them their body back.
	        Without the monitor (game.forge_monitor off, or no c40.map):
	        detach the camera from the player and fly it freely, through
	        walls; again moves the player to the camera and returns the
	        camera to the player
	1 / D-pad right or X, only while flying
	        open or close the spawn menu: every vehicle, weapon, equipment,
	        biped and scenery object of the map (the menu is part of forge
	        mode: landing the camera closes it). X with the crosshair on a
	        spawn point, a zone or an object opens it on the tab that is
	        about that thing (the mods' properties hook, halo_mod.h), with
	        it chosen
	F4, and while flying also enter, the left mouse button or A
	        pick up the object under the crosshair
	Y, while flying
	        remove the object under the crosshair (Delete with forge_edit)

While flying: W A S D (left stick) move level, the way the view faces
whatever its pitch, the mouse (right stick) looks, R and F (RB and LB) rise
and sink straight up and down, and shift (the left trigger, LT) is faster:
the monitor flies its unit so (units/bipeds.c), the free camera itself. The
rest of this paragraph is the free camera's: the arrows' up and down change
the speed. Z (right stick click) hands the controls back to the player and
leaves the camera where it is, as the game's own debug flying camera does
(camera/director.c).

In the menu: up and down choose, left and right change the category, enter,
the left mouse button or A take the object, escape, backspace, the right
mouse button or B close the menu. After the object categories come the
pages that source mods add (halo_mod.h, struct halo_mod_menu): rows with a
value that left and right change and that enter or A act on. T and V, or LB
and RB, go to the previous and next tab on every page; X closes the menu too.
The mouse's wheel chooses as up and down do, and with the left button held
on a mod's row changes its value as left and right do.

The menu is drawn after the forge
menu of Halo: Reach: a navy panel with the tab's name and its place among
the tabs (the map's objects by kind, then the mods' pages) between LB and
RB, the tab's rows under it (how many of each object the map has, and its
name in capitals), and the A and B buttons along the bottom. The highlight
glides to the chosen row and the panel fades in. It keeps its
place while it is closed: the category, and in each category the chosen row
(by tag name, so it carries over to other maps that have the same tag) and
how far the list is scrolled. The place lasts for the whole session and is
written to u:\forge_ui.txt (forge_ui.txt in the directory u/ of the save
root, ~/.local/share/halo-linux/u/) when the menu closes, and read back the
first time it opens after the game starts. A closed menu does nothing else.

A taken or picked up object is held where the crosshair (the middle of the
view, which is not drawn) points, standing on the surface there, until it
is placed:
	left, right     turn it about the chosen axis
	up, down        raise and lower it
	T               choose the axis: yaw, pitch or roll
	V / X           choose the step: free, or 15, 45, 90 or 180 degrees
	enter, left mouse button / A
	                put it down
	escape, backspace / B
	                cancel: a spawned object goes, a picked up one returns
	right mouse button, held while flying
	                the mouse turns it: left and right about its yaw, up and
	                down about its pitch, by the chosen step
	delete / back, Y
	                remove it from the map
While flying, the right stick orbits the camera around the held object,
which then stays that far in front of the camera wherever it flies (LB and
RB lower and raise both), and with the right trigger (RT) held the right
stick turns the object instead: left and right about its yaw, up and down
about its pitch, while the left stick's forward and back take the camera
nearer to it and further away.
The platform layer keeps these keys and buttons from the game while the
menu is open or an object is held.

The keys belong to the player on controller 1, the keyboard and the first
gamepad, and act on local player 0.

System link: every player of a Forge game builds. Spawning, moving and
removing objects change the game state, which is the host's
(network_distributed.c): the host's tools change it as in a local game, and
its clients see it as they see the rest of its game (its units and items
through network_objects.c, its scenery, devices and the mods' parts through
the layout it sends, forge_layout.c). A client's tools ask the host
(forge_layout_client_edit): the menu's object is spawned where the
crosshair points, to be picked up from there; an object picked up moves on
the client alone until it is put down, which the host then does; a removed
one the host removes. The mods' pages and the Map tab are the host's.

A page may ask for a line of text (forge_text_entry_begin, the Map tab's
names and descriptions, a prefab's name, an object's comment): it is typed on
the keyboard, which until enter or escape belongs to it alone, or on an
on-screen keyboard laid out and worked as the one a profile's name is typed
on (virtual_keyboard.c, whose tags only ui.map has): the D-pad chooses a key,
A presses it, X deletes, the triggers move the cursor, start takes the line
and B leaves it. As there, the first key replaces the line it began with.
