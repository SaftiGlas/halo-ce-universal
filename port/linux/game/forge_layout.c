/*
FORGE_LAYOUT.C

Layouts of the dev tools (port/linux/game/forge.c): what Forge changed in a
map, saved to a file and loaded again. A layout loads only when it is asked
for: by the Map tab's "Load it", or by choosing it as a map in the map list.
The map chosen by its own name is the map as the game has it.

A layout holds:
	the objects the tools or mods made (spawned, pasted, brought back):
	        their tag, place, turn and scale
	the map's own objects that the tools moved or removed: found again by
	        their tag and the place the map puts them
	each mod's part (halo_mod.h, layout_save / layout_clear / layout_load):
	        spawns, zones, AI characters and waypoints, gravity, the sky

The map's own objects are noted when the map has placed them (the new map
hook, forge_layout_new_map), before a layout is loaded. Objects that the
game makes later (the weapons of a multiplayer map's spawn points, vehicles
that respawn) are not the map's own here: moving one saves a copy of it,
and the game still makes its own.

Files: a layout is a map variant, d:\forge_maps\<name>.mvar beside the
maps' custom_maps folder (forge_mvar.h, docs/forge_mvar.md): binary chunks
of the variant's name, description and base map, its objects (an id, the
type and tag, place, turn as a quaternion, scale, team, spawn flags and the
game types it is in), each mod's part and the editor's notes. The Map tab
lists the variants of the map it is on, in the order of their file names
(up to FORGE_LAYOUT_SLOT_COUNT); a new one is named for its name. Its name
and description are changed by the Map tab's Name and Description rows
(typed on the keyboard), and by the launcher (python -m tools.mod_launcher
layouts). Only the game's machine writes them (a local game, a system link
host): a client plays the host's variant and keeps none.

The layouts of before, u:\forge\<map>\layout_NN.txt in the save root (text,
one thing a line), are made variants once, when the variants are first
looked for: each gets a .mvar, and the .txt stays where it was (the slots
made are noted in u:\forge\<map>\converted.txt).

The "Map" tab of the tools' menu: choose a layout (left, right), name and
describe it, save it, load it, show it in
the map list, reset the map to its own look, remove every object of the
map (asked twice: the map's own come back with the reset, the tools' do
not), delete it. In a system link game the tab is the host's.

System link: the host's game is the game. What it changes reaches its
clients as its objects do (units and items, network_objects.c) and, for the
rest (scenery, devices, the mods' parts), as the layout's variant: sent to a
client when it has loaded, and again to every client when it has changed
(forge_layout_host_sync); the client applies it and saves nothing. A client's own tools ask the host to
spawn, move or remove an object (forge_layout_client_edit, a
_distributed_message_forge_edit), and the host does it.

A layout shown in the map list (its mvhd's listed) is a map of its
own: the multiplayer map list of local (splitscreen) games offers it after
the 13 maps of the game, with its base map's picture and the layout's name
(interface/ui_widget_event_handler_functions.c and
ui_widget_game_data_input_functions.c ask forge_custom_map_*; its name
comes through text/text_group.c's fallback strings). Choosing it plays the
base map with that layout loaded (forge_custom_map_select).
