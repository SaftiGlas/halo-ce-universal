/*
FORGE_MONITOR.C

Forge's builder as the monitor (343 Guilty Spark): Home / D-pad up makes the
player's unit a monitor biped, which flies where the player looks, and again
gives the player a body of the game's back where the monitor is
(port/linux/game/forge.c). A player flies in Forge while their unit is the
monitor: that is the game's state, the host's in a system link game, so
every machine sees every builder's monitor as it sees any unit.

The monitor is no tag of a multiplayer map: it comes from The Maw (c40.map)
as a Forge game's map loads, by the import of tags from other maps
(port/linux/game/tag_import.c), on every machine alike, so its tag has the
same index on all of them. With game.forge_monitor off, or without The Maw,
there is no monitor and Forge flies its camera free of the player, as it did
(camera/director_forge.c).

The monitor moves by the unit's throttle, as Forge's free camera flew
(units/bipeds.c, a player's flying biped): forward and sideways level, the
way the player faces whatever the pitch of their view, and straight up and
down with the tools' rise and sink keys (R and F, RB and LB), faster with
their fast key (shift, LT). The keys reach the game as unit control flags
(forge_monitor_control_flags: jump, crouch and FORGE_MONITOR_FAST_BIT;
game/players.c makes the first two the throttle's third part), so a client's
host flies its monitor as it does.

In first person the monitor's own lens flares (its eye's) are not drawn:
they would fill the view (objects/object_lights.c,
forge_monitor_hides_lens_flares). While it turns what it holds (the right
trigger, or the right mouse button, forge.c), the look and the throttle are
the held object's, as the free camera's are (forge_monitor_control_input).
