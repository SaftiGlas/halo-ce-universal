/*
FORGE_MVAR.H

Forge's map variants (port/linux/game/forge_layout.c) as files: the .mvar
format's chunks, written and read a byte at a time, little-endian, never as
the structures below are laid out in memory (the builds' ABIs differ). The
format is described in docs/forge_mvar.md.

A file is a run of chunks, each a header (four letters, the size of what
follows, a version and flags) and its contents:

	_blf    "mvar", the file's length and a CRC-32 of every chunk after it
	mvhd    the variant's name, description, author, base map, times, whether
	        the map list shows it, the next free object id
	strt    the tag paths the objects name, each once
	mvob    the objects, one record of FORGE_MVAR_OBJECT_RECORD_SIZE each
	mved    the editor's notes about objects: group, comment (left out of
	        what a system link host sends its clients)
	mvst    each Forge part's settings (spawns, zones, AI, gravity, sky): its
	        name and its lines (halo_mod.h, layout_save)
	_eof    the end

A reader skips a chunk it does not know, and reads the fields of a record
it knows, skipping the rest of a longer one: later versions may add both.
Everything read is untrusted: every reader here checks the length left
before it reads, and fails from then on once one did not fit.
