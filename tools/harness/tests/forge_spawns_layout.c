/*
FORGE_SPAWNS_LAYOUT.C (test)

A layout's spawn lines (port/linux/game/forge_spawns.c,
forge_spawns_layout_load): a layout comes from a file or from the host of a
system link game, so what a line names is checked before it is a spawn: a
team in range, the game types the game has, a facing that is a number.
test_forge_spawns_layout.py takes the constants (config.inc) and the code
(under_test.inc).
