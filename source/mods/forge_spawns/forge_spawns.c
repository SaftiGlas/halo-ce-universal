/*
FORGE_SPAWNS.C

A source mod (mods/forge_spawns): the map's spawn points, shown, moved,
removed and added with the dev tools' crosshair (port/linux/game/forge.c).

A map has two kinds, both lists of its scenario and neither an object:

	player spawns   where players start and come back (scenario->players,
	                struct player_starting_location): a place, a facing, a
	                team and the game types it is for. The game rates every
	                one for the player and takes the best
	                (find_best_starting_location_index, game/players.c;
	                game_engine_get_starting_location_rating,
	                game/game_engine.c): none of another game type or with
	                a vehicle on it, in team games none of the other team,
	                less the nearer an enemy is (none within 2 world
	                units), more near teammates, and each by a random part
	item spawns     where weapons, grenades and powerups come back
	                (scenario->netgame_equipment, struct
	                scenario_netgame_equipment): a place, the game types it
	                is for, an item collection and a time. Each makes one
	                item of its collection every time the game's clock
	                passes a multiple of its time (its own, else its
	                collection's, else 30 seconds;
	                game_engine_update_item_spawn, game/game_engine.c)

Everything that reads them reads those two lists, so a kind that is changed
here is the map's list copied to one of this mod's, which the scenario then
has in its place; "Restore the map's own" gives the scenario its own back.
The map's file is never changed.

Everything is in the dev tools' menu (1, D-pad right or, flying, X), on the
"Spawns" tab:

	Show spawns     draw them in the world: a post with an arrow the way it
	                faces, red or blue by team (white for neither), item
	                spawns yellow and shorter. Only in forge mode (flying)
	                or while one is held: never on foot
	Kind            player spawns or item spawns: what the rows below are
	                about
	New spawn       close the menu and hold a new one at the crosshair,
	                like the chosen one in everything but its place
	Spawn           which one the rows below are about (with the spawns
	                shown, aiming at one with the menu closed chooses it,
	                and X on a controller opens the menu here on it)
	Team            (player) red or blue
	Game types      every game, every game but CTF, every game but CTF and
	                race, or one of them
	Items           (item) the item collection
	Respawn time    (item) the collection's own, or seconds
	Pick up and move
	                hold it as the tools hold an object: aim to move it,
	                left/right turn it (V / X: free, or in steps), up/down
	                raise and lower it, enter or A put it down, escape or B
	                put it back, delete, Back or Y remove it. Aiming at one
	                and pressing F4 (or enter / A while flying) picks it up
	                the same way, unless an object is nearer.
	Move here       to the crosshair, turned the way the camera looks
	Remove
	Remove all      of the kind, to place the map's spawns anew
	Restore the map's own

With no player spawn nobody can start: a layout saved then keeps the map's.
The spawns are part of layouts (forge_layout.c) and so reach the clients of
a system link game, where they are the host's to change.
